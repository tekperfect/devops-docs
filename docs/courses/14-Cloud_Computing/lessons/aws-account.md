# Amazon Web Services Free Tier 

1. Before I have you all signup for a free tier AWS account I want you all to know that you will be responsiable for charges to that account if you don't pay attention to the services you use and launch any services that are not free. AWS support has a plethora of options and if you ask someone will lead you in the right direction to avoid any charges. I recommend that you all take advantage of the 750 hours or one year of free tier usage and set an appointment to terminate the account prior to you exceeding those hours. 

2. To signup for a free tier account you will need to go to the following URL.

3. Please note you and only your will be soley responsiable for any charges incurred with using the account if they are used improperly. You and only you will be responsiable for any fees associated with the account if it is compromised.

4. The reason why we are covering this is because the use of cloud services comes with a great deal of responsiability. These services can also be used to store inappropriate content if compromised, and can be use to attack environments if not properly secured.

5. Throughout this milestone you will be asked to spin up and tear down cloud services and at the end of each lesson I will remind you all to make sure no services are running that will eat up your 750 hours of free tier usage beyond the class time usage hours. However, you and only only will be responsiable for checking to make sure those services you spun up are no long in use.

### Securing Your Account

1. Once you have secured your account with some assistance from your instructor I would recommend reviewing your account in the IAM services profile to make sure you have a password that is at least 12-16 characters and you have 2FA Two Factor Authenication enabled and the root password to your account is stored in LastPass.

2. Once that is complete you will create a second user in AWS tha will be your standard login account which we will setup with restricted access to prevent the unauthorized launching of non free tier instances. Please note these safety measures we are going to employ are not a gurantee that you will be protected from launching non free tier services. Please pay careful attention and consult with AWS support before launching anything tha is not deemed free tier access.

3. With a secured root account and a standard login setup. You can now proceed to establishing a foundation for creating new instances and getting a fell for the AWS environment.
