# Amazon Web Services Free Tier 

1. Before I have you all signup for a free tier AWS account I want you all to know that you will be responsiable for charges to that account if you don't pay attention to the services you use and launch any services that are not free. AWS support has a plethora of options and if you ask someone will lead you in the right direction to avoid any charges. I recommend that you all take advantage of the 750 hours or one year of free tier usage and set an appointment to terminate the account prior to you exceeding those hours. 

2. To signup for a free tier account you will need to go to the following URL.

3. Please note you and only your will be soley responsiable for any charges incurred with using the account if they are used improperly. You and only you will be responsiable for any fees associated with the account if it is compromised.

4. The reason why we are covering this is because the use of cloud services comes with a great deal of responsiability. These services can also be used to store inappropriate content if compromised, and can be use to attack environments if not properly secured.

5. Throughout this milestone you will be asked to spin up and tear down cloud services and at the end of each lesson I will remind you all to make sure no services are running that will eat up your 750 hours of free tier usage beyond the class time usage hours. However, you and only only will be responsiable for checking to make sure those services you spun up are no long in use.

### Securing Your Account

1. Once you have secured your account with some assistance from your instructor I would recommend reviewing your account in the IAM services profile to make sure you have a password that is at least 12-16 characters and you have 2FA Two Factor Authenication enabled and the root password to your account is stored in LastPass.

2. Once that is complete you will create a second user in AWS tha will be your standard login account which we will setup with restricted access to prevent the unauthorized launching of non free tier instances. Please note these safety measures we are going to employ are not a gurantee that you will be protected from launching non free tier services. Please pay careful attention and consult with AWS support before launching anything tha is not deemed free tier access.

3. With a secured root account and a standard login setup. You can now proceed to establishing a foundation for creating new instances and getting a fell for the AWS environment.

### Creating an IAM User

1. Login as your root account user which should be associated with your email address.

2 On the Console Home page, select the IAM service.

3. In the navigation pane, select Users and then select Add users.

4. On the Specify user details page, under User details, in User name, enter the name for the new user. This is their sign-in name for AWS.

5. Select Provide user access to the ‚Äì AWS Management Console optional This produces AWS Management Console sign-in credentials for the new user. (You definately want this if you want your user to be able to access the web console)

6. Please select the option I want to create an IAM user and continue following this procedure.

7. For Console password, select one of the following:

8. Autogenerated password ‚Äì The user gets a randomly generated password that meets the account password policy. You can view or download the password when you get to the Retrieve password page.

9. Custom password ‚Äì The user is assigned the password that you enter in the box.

10. (Optional) Users must create a new password at next sign-in (recommended) is selected by default to ensure that the user is forced to change their password the first time they sign in.i

11. Select Next.

12. On the Set permissions page, specify how you want to assign permissions for this user. Select one of the following three options:

13. Add user to group ‚Äì Select this option if you want to assign the user to one or more groups that already have permissions policies. IAM displays a list of the groups in your account, along with their attached policies. You can select one or more existing groups, or select Create group to create a new group. For more information, see Changing permissions for an IAM user.

Copy permissions ‚Äì Select this option to copy all of the group memberships, attached managed policies, embedded inline policies, and any existing permissions boundaries from an existing user to the new user. IAM displays a list of the users in your account. Select the one whose permissions most closely match the needs of your new user.

Attach policies directly ‚Äì Select this option to see a list of the AWS managed and customer managed policies in your account. Select the policies that you want to attach to the user or select Create policy to open a new browser tab and create a new policy. For more information, see step 4 in the procedure Creating IAM policies. After you create the policy, close that tab and return to your original tab to add the policy to the user.

(Optional) Set a permissions boundary. This is an advanced feature.

14. For the purposes of this lab select the Add User to group option and create a group called "SuperAdmin" and attach the Adminstrator Access policy to that group and assign that user you are creating to the group.

15. Select Next.


16. Review all of the choices you made up to this point. When you are ready to proceed, select Create user.


17. Select Download .csv to download the user's sign in credentials as a .csv file that you can save to a safe location.

18. (Optional) Select Email sign-in instructions. Your local mail client opens with a draft that you can customize and send to the user. The email template includes the following details to each user: Another option is to share the credentials with the user via a password manager like LastPass or 1Password.

15. Finally please document or make note of the URL to the account sign-in page. Use the following example, substituting the correct account ID number or account alias:

https://AWS-account-ID or alias.signin.aws.amazon.com/console

Please note you should work with your instructor to setup Two Factor Authenication on both your Root account and named account. We highly recommend that no one use the root account for normal AWS cloud operations and only use it for account lockout, billing issue, and other special circumstances.
