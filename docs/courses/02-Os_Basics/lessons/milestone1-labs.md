Installing applications

1. `sudo apt install apache2`

2. `sudo apt install mysql-server`

3. `sudo apt install postgresql`

4. `sudo apt install unzip`

5. `sudo apt install net-tools`

6. Now I want you to do the following to complete these labs. Create 5 new users with the following names: `barack sonia hiro priyanka dwayne` Their full names when creating he accounts should be `Barack Obama Sonia Sotomayor Hiro Murai Priyanka Chopra Dwayne Johnson`.

7. Now create 5 groups `finance hr it marketing sales` using the following command `sudo groupadd group_name`

10. For example if you wanted to add barack to the it group you would run the following command `sudo usermod -a -G it barack`

11. Now I want to use the scp command to copy all the labs files you downloaded earlier on your Mac to /tmp folder location on your Ubuntu server. Remeber the sytax for the command is `scp filename_you_want_to_copy username@xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:/tmp`

12. If you want to copy all the files in zip files you downloaded on your Mac with one scp command what would that command look like. (Hint: You would use the *.zip wildcard with the scp command.

13. After you have all of the zip files are copied over to your Ubuntu server VM move the files from your /tmp folder to your home folder.

14. What is the command to move the files from the /tmp folder to your home folder?
# RECONFIGURE APACHE WEB SERVER 

15. Once the files are in your home folder. Use the unzip command to unzip the files?

16. How do you know if the files are unzipped?

**\* Lab Exercises**

Fun with Apache2

1. Before you start making changes to your apache server you want to backup the main index.html file to a backup folder. This will ensure you can restore the apache server to it's original configuration.

2. To accomplish this taks you need to use the cd command to cd to the /var/www/html folder.

3. Create a directory in the /var/www/html folder called backup and copy the /var/www/html/index.html file into the backup folder.

4. Once you can confirm you have the back folder and the copy of the index.html folder run a pwd command while in the /var/www/html folder and you should see a folder called back cd into the backup folder and run an ls -al command and you should see the index.html file. If you do not then you either created the folder in the wrong location or you copy command did not work properly make sure you use sudo with most of your commands since you will be creating files and folders in priviliged directories.

5. After you have confirmed you have a backup copy of the index.html file edit the original index.html file located in the /var/www/html folder by using the vi command.

6. While in vi change the the following in the index.html`It works!` to `Your Name is the best`.

7. Obviously you want to use your actual name place of Your Name.

8. This exercise may be tricky for folks please reference the vi cheatsheet if you have any trouble editing the file.

## VI Cheatsheet üëáüèæ
[![VI Cheatsheet](cheatsheet.png)](https://www.atmos.albany.edu/daes/atmclasses/atm350/vi_cheat_sheet.pdf)

9. Save the changes and restart apache. Do know how to save changes in a file that you are editing in vi? (Hint <esc key> :wq)

10. To restart apache you need to run the following command `sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart`

11. Now open browser on your mac and plug in the IP address of your ubuntu server VM. Do you know what the IP address is and how to find it?

12. You should see the edited Apache2 page with your name is the best. If you don't see that then you may have missed a step or have a typo in the changes you made.

13. Copy the sample-1.png file located in images folder in your home directory to /var/www/html.

14. Now edit the index.html file located in /var/www/html with vi and change the line `<img src="icons/ubuntu-logo.png" alt="Ubuntu Logo"` to `<img src="sample-1.png" alt="Ubuntu Logo"`   

15. Save the changes to the index.html file and restart apache.

16. Open or refresh the browser page you opened before to see what changes occured with your apache instance.

17. I know these exercisses are challenging but if you master the navigation, copy, move, remove, editing, searching, and locating of files you will be able navigate the linux files system from a command line with ease.

# DEMO WHAT YOU KNOW

1. Work with your instructor and go into a breakout room.

2. Your instructor will give you an assignment that will demonstrate the use of all the commands and skills you have learned so far.

3. Please remeber this is not a test you can use documenation from the google classrom to help you answer the questions. You can also use the man command and search the Internet to provide the answer to your quesitons. Please remeber to test the commands on your Ubuntu server in order to validate they are correct. You should also use the ls, ls -al, and pwd commands to validate where you are and where you want to go.

4. Your instructor strongly recommends using the <tab> key so that your ssh, scp, cp, mv, rm, mkdir, adduser, chown, and chgrp commands are successful and you don't have typos.

5. Good luck with the exercises and please put all the commands in the assessment file located in the google drive folder associated with your name.
