A financial plan is a document provides a clear picture of an individuals financial outlook. It also includes the strategy an individual utilizes to meet their financial goals.

Things to consider when constructing a finacial plan.

The financial plan should be thorough and realistic but also customized to meet the financial goals of the individual. The plan should also take into consideration the individual‚Äôs spending habits, family obligations, risk tolerance, and future goals. The plan must include calculation of the person‚Äôs current net worth, cash flow, and include a strategy.

Net Worth

To figure out your current net worth, list all of the following:

Your assets: This may include a home and a car, cash in the bank, money invested in a 401(k) plan, and anything else of value that you own.

Your liabilities: These may include credit card debt, student debt, an outstanding mortgage, and a car loan.

The formula for your current net worth is your total assets minus your total liabilities.

Determining cash flow

I would be ill advised to create a financial plan without knowing when and how your money is curretly being earned and spent. Documenting transactions and determining the cash flow will help you determine how much you need every month for your basic needs, how much might be left for saving and investing. This cash flow analysis will also inform you of how much you spend on basic necessities and even shed light on unnecessary spending.

### Budgeting

If your expenses are unpredectiable, then it would be wise to review 12 months of them to determine your monthly average.

It is also wise to keep an eye on cash withdrawals or spending that is not easily tracked. This can create a false sense of your cash flow which may result in an incomplete picture of your financial situation. 

Invest the appropriate amount of time to document your income and basic housing expenses like rent or mortgage payments, utilities, and credit card payments, Adding categories for food, clothing, transportation, and medical insurance, then document separately your real spending on entertainment, dining out, and travel.

Considering your priorities

The core of a financial plan is a person‚Äôs clearly defined goals which may include retirement, investing in a businesss, or planning to support a family member.

No one can tell you how to prioritize these goals. However, a professional financial planner may be able to help you choose a strategy and specific investments that will help reach your goals efficiently.

Lending discrimination occurs when lenders base credit decisions on factors other than the applicant‚Äôs creditworthiness. Denying financial services to residents of certain neighborhoods due to race or ethnicity is called redlining.
The discriminatory practice of redlining made it impossible for many members of the POC community for mortgage loans. Redlining is one of the many factors behind the racial wealth gap that persists in the U.S. today. Laws today prohibit discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, national origin, handicap, familial status, age, and income. However, these practices have evolved to continue to deny indiviudals who have traditionally not be able to participate in the economy that allows most people to gain generational wealth.``
