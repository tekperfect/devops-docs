What Is a Financial Plan?

A financial plan is a document provides a clear picture of an individuals financial situation and financial goals as they relate to the future. It also includes the methology and execution strategy to achieve those goals. A financial plan begins with a thorough analysis of an individuals financial situation and future expectations. This plan can start of very simple with very specific goals that are attributed to savings and cash flow and gradually become more complicated and intricate and include stock investment, portfolio diversification, and retirement goals.

Things to note when building a finacial plan.

The plan should be as comprehensive as possible  but also customized to meet the needs and financial maturity of the individual. The plan should also take into consideration the individual’s personal and family situations, risk tolerance, and future expectations.
The plan starts with a calculation of the person’s current net worth, cash flow, and ends with a strategy.


The Fundamentals of a solid financial plan should also take into consideration if the assistance of a financial planner is needed. However, the first steps to the plan should include gathering all the necessary information to  understand your present financial situation and make sure it is documented well by performing the following tasks.


Calculating net worth
To figure out your current net worth, list all of the following:

Your assets: This may include a home and a car, cash in the bank, money invested in a 401(k) plan, and anything else of value that you own.

Your liabilities: These may include credit card debt, student debt, an outstanding mortgage, and a car loan.

The formula for your current net worth is your total assets minus your total liabilities.

Determining cash flow

I would be ill advised to create a financial plan without knowing when and how your money is curretly being earned and spent. Documenting transactions and determining the cash flow will help you determine how much you need every month for your basic needs, how much might be left for saving and investing. This cash flow analysis will also inform you of how much you spend on basic necessities and even shed light on unnecessary spending.

### Budgeting

If your expenses are unpredectiable, then it would be wise to review 12 months of them to determine your monthly average.

It is also wise to keep an eye on cash withdrawals or spending that is not easily tracked. This can create a false sense of your cash flow which may result in an incomplete picture of your financial situation. 

Invest the appropriate amount of time to document your income and basic housing expenses like rent or mortgage payments, utilities, credit card interest, and home furnishings. Add categories for food, clothing, transportation, medical insurance, and non-covered medical expenses, then document separately your real spending on entertainment, dining out, and vacation/travel.

Considering your priorities

The core of a financial plan is a person’s clearly defined goals which may include retirement, investing in a businesss, or planning to support a family member.

No one can tell you how to prioritize these goals. However, a professional financial planner may be able to help you choose a strategy and specific investments that will help reach your goals efficiently.

### Retirement

The main elements of a financial plan include a retirement strategy, a risk management plan, a long-term investment plan, a tax reduction strategy, and an estate plan.


The following elements should be addressed and revised as necessary:

Retirement strategy: No matter what your priorities are, the plan should include a strategy for accumulating the retirement income that you need.

### Risk management

Comprehensive risk management plan: This includes a review of life and disability insurance, personal liability coverage, property and casualty coverage, and catastrophic coverage.

Long-term investment plan: A customized plan based on specific investment objectives and a personal risk tolerance profile.
Tax reduction strategy: A strategy for minimizing taxes on personal income to the extent allowed by the tax code.
Estate plan: Arrangements for the benefit and protection of your heirs.
What is the Purpose of a Financial Plan?
A financial plan is designed to help you make the best use of your money and achieve long-term financial goals, whether they are sending your children to college, buying a bigger home, leaving a legacy, or enjoying a comfortable retirement.

### Taxes

The United States of America has separate federal, state, and local governments with taxes imposed at each of these levels. Taxes are levied on income, payroll, property, sales, capital gains, dividends, imports, estates and gifts, as well as various fees. In 2020, taxes collected by federal, state, and local governments amounted to 25.5% of GDP, below the OECD average of 33.5% of GDP. The United States had the seventh-lowest tax revenue-to-GDP ratio among OECD countries in 2020, with a higher ratio than Mexico, Colombia, Chile, Ireland, Costa Rica, and Turkey.[1]

Taxes fall much more heavily on labor income than on capital income. Divergent taxes and subsidies for different forms of income and spending can also constitute a form of indirect taxation of some activities over others. For example, individual spending on higher education can be said to be "taxed" at a high rate, compared to other forms of personal expenditure which are formally recognized as investments.

### How credit work

Credit cards have a credit limit you can make purchases against. then repay at a later date.
Carrying a balance on a credit card can trigger interest charges. 
It's important to read the fine print closely on credit card promotional offers.
Some credit cards allow you to earn rewards on purchases in the form of points, miles or cash back.s

A credit card is a physical card that can be used to make purchases, pay bills or depending on the card, withdraw cash. The simplest way to think of a credit card is as a type of short term loan.
When you open a credit card account, your credit card company gives you a set credit limit. This is essentially an amount of money the credit card company allows you to use to make purchases or pay bills.

### Discriminatory practices

Laws today protect borrowers from discriminatory lending practices, but that wasn’t always the case. For decades U.S. banks denied mortgages to Black families—and those belonging to other racial and ethnic minority groups—who lived in certain areas “redlined” by a federal government agency called the Home Owners’ Loan Corporation (HOLC).

Lending discrimination occurs when lenders base credit decisions on factors other than the applicant’s creditworthiness.
Denying financial services to residents of certain neighborhoods due to race or ethnicity is called redlining.
The discriminatory practice of redlining made it impossible for many members of racial and ethnic minority groups to qualify for mortgage loans.
Redlining is one factor behind the racial wealth gap that persists in the U.S. today.
Laws today forbid discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, national origin, handicap, familial status, age, and whether you receive public assistance income. However, these practices have evolved to continue to deny indiviudals who have traditionally not be able to participate in the economy that allows most people to gain generational wealth.``

### Generational wealth

Generational wealth refers to any kind of asset that families pass down to their children or grandchildren, whether in the form of cash, investment funds, stocks and bonds, properties or even entire companies.
