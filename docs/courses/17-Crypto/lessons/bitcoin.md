### Bitcoin

Currently, there are just over 18,800 000 Bitcoins in existence. Bitcoins are created by a process known as “Bitcoin mining” and distributed in the form of Bitcoin block rewards.

The bitcoin mining process sees every transaction on the Bitcoin network checked and verified by the distributed network. This is done through a complex process where specialized computers compete to solve algorithms. The computer that successfully solves the algorithm and confirms the Bitcoin transactions within a block on the blockchain is then rewarded with Bitcoins for its work. This is a very simple and brief explanation of how new Bitcoins are created. 

Currently, the reward for Bitcoin mining is 6.25 BTC for each successful block mined, and this happens about every 10 minutes. 

Every 4 years, the reward rate is halved, in an event called “the halving.” This gradual decrease of issuing new Bitcoin is why it will be about another 120 years until all Bitcoins have been mined.

A Hedge Against Banking
The text embedded in the coinbase of the genesis block gives a clear indication of Satoshi Nakamoto’s motive to create a new currency. The message is a headline from an article in the January 3, 2009 edition of The [London] Times. The article detailed the British government’s failure to stimulate the economy following the 2007–08 financial crisis.

A huge driver for Bitcoins creation was Nakamoto’s concern about “too-big-to-fail” financial institutions. Nakomoto wanted Bitcoin to be able to provide individuals a way to have full control over their finances, without a corporate middleman. 

This is what is meant when Bitcoin is described as “trustless”. Traditionally, parties sending money have relied on a middleman, usually a bank, to facilitate the transaction. 

With Bitcoin and blockchain technology, both sending and receiving parties don’t need to trust each other to make a transaction with Bitcoin. The protocols, or the code, of Bitcoin allow the system to work and achieve consensus without a third party. 

Without having to trust the entity with which you are transacting, true peer-to-peer transactions can take place.

Exchanges Centralized and Decentralized

For most digital currency investors, the centralized cryptocurrency exchange is one of the most important vehicles for transacting. Centralized cryptocurrency exchanges are online platforms used to buy and sell cryptocurrencies. They are the most common means that investors use to buy and sell cryptocurrency holdings.

Some investors may find the concept of a "centralized" exchange to be somewhat misleading, as digital currencies themselves are often billed as "decentralized." What does it mean for an exchange of this type to be "centralized," and why are these exchanges so crucial for the success of the cryptocurrency industry as a whole?


Use of Third Parties
In the term "centralized cryptocurrency exchange," the idea of centralization refers to the use of a middle man or third party to help conduct transactions. Buyers and sellers alike trust this middle man to handle their assets. This is common in a bank setup, where a customer trusts the bank to hold his or her money.

The reason for this setup is that banks offer security and monitoring that an individual cannot accomplish on his or her own. In the case of a centralized cryptocurrency exchange, the same principle applies. Transactors trust not only that the exchange will safely complete their transactions for them, but also that it will make use of the network of users in the exchange in order to find trading partners.

In the case of cryptocurrencies, which are often stored in digital wallets, an individual can lose hundreds or thousands of dollars in digital currency holdings simply by forgetting the key to a wallet. An exchange will not allow this to happen, as it safeguards the holdings in place of the individual investor.

Differences Between Centralized and Decentralized Exchanges
Centralized exchanges can be used to conduct trades from fiat to cryptocurrency (or vice versa). They can also be used to conduct trades between two different cryptocurrencies. While this may seem to cover all of the potential transaction types, there is still a market for another type of cryptocurrency exchange as well.

Decentralized exchanges are an alternative; they cut out the middle man, generating what is often thought of as a "trustless" environment. These types of exchanges function as peer-to-peer exchanges. Assets are never held by an escrow service, and transactions are done entirely based on smart contracts and atomic swaps.

The crucial difference between centralized and decentralized exchanges is whether or not a middle man is present. Decentralized exchanges are less widespread and less popular as compared with centralized exchanges. Nonetheless, there are more decentralized exchanges all the time, and it's possible that they will give centralized exchanges a run for their money in the future.


Fiat/Cryptocurrency Pairs
It's more common for a centralized exchange to offer cryptocurrency/cryptocurrency pairing at this point. This would allow customers to trade, for instance, bitcoin for ether tokens. Fewer exchanges offer fiat currency/cryptocurrency pairs, which would allow, say, bitcoin for USD exchanges.

Some of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world are those that offer these fiat/cryptocurrency pairs, however. Part of the reason for this is likely that they serve as a direct access point to the cryptocurrency market.

Since many investors in the space are relatively new to investing in digital currencies, they may be more likely to turn to these types of exchanges. Some of these exchanges include Coinbase, Robinhood, Kraken, and Gemini.

Key Elements of Centralized Exchanges
There are new centralized cryptocurrency exchanges all the time. However, not all of them will be successful, and it's not uncommon for these exchanges to fold. The success or failure of an exchange is dependent upon a large number of factors. However, one of the key components to success is trading volume.

Generally speaking, the higher the levels of trading volume, the lower the volatility and market manipulation that's likely to take place on that exchange. Volatility is a crucial consideration. Because of the time it takes for transactions to be completed, the price of a given token or coin can change between the time the transaction is initiated and the time it is finished. The higher the trade volume and the faster the transaction can be processed, the less likely this fluctuation is to be problem.

Another crucial element of a successful centralized exchange is security. While no exchange is completely immune to malicious activity like hacks, some are safer than others.


Crypto Swaps

What is crypto swapping?
Crypto swapping allows you to instantly trade one cryptocurrency for another, with no crypto-to-fiat exchange required. Saving time and paying less in fees are obvious benefits, but it’s far from the only reason users participate in swapping.

Crypto tokens are effectively the keys to their native blockchain’s kingdom, affording holders various benefits within their ecosystems. Token holders may have the opportunity to vote on community governance proposals that guide the future of a project or stake their share in exchange for passive interest income. Swapping makes it easier for crypto users to explore the further reaches of the blockchain, and be a part of multiple projects they wish to support.

Sometimes swaps are necessary to cover the fees on a transaction that can only be paid in a specific blockchain’s native coin. Other times, traders will perform a token swap in the hopes of capitalizing on a move in the market they sense is coming. Participating in certain protocols, such as decentralized finance (DeFi), can only be done via specific blockchains. This means if you’re a Bitcoin user, you may need to swap for some Ethereum or another ERC-20-compatible token if you want access to the DeFi ecosystem.

Crypto swap vs exchange/trade
It’s true that the words “swap” and “trade” can be taken as synonyms, but in crypto parlance they have quite different meanings. Although the end result is essentially the same (start with one coin, end with another), their respective processes vary greatly.

Trading requires exchanging one cryptocurrency for fiat and then purchasing another coin with the fiat you obtained. If taking place on a crypto exchange, you’ll be hit with whatever commission or other fees they charge on both sides of the transaction.

Swapping, on the other hand, allows users to seamlessly transfer one cryptocurrency for an equal amount in value of another. Transactions happen instantaneously, and without the need to first exchange crypto for fiat. Crypto exchanges offer up various “trading pairs”, asset combinations that can be swapped within their platform. Different swap services offer different trading pairs, and those allowing swaps between two very small or obscure coins may be more difficult to find.
