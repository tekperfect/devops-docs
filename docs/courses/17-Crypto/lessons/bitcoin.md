### Bitcoin

Bitcoin is the most recognized and widely used cryptocurrency. It leverages the use of a decentralized protocol, cryptography, and a method to obtain consensus on the state of a periodically updated public transaction ledger called a blockchain. 

Bitcoin is a form of digital currency that exists independently of any government, state, or financial institution, and can be transferred globally without the need for a centralized intermediary, bank or other financial institution and is a financial instrument that cannot be altered.

Bitcoin can be described in many ways. However, it is fundamentally different in from fiat currency. Primarily because it encompases many technical features, hosts a multitude of integrations, and includes a clearly defined process for making changes to the protocol.

Bitcoin or BTC the ticket symbol can be referenced in many ways. However, the name of the currency and it functions is interchangable.

Bitcoin was launched anonymously in January 2009 by Satoshi Nakamoto. Bitcoin popularity and price continue to be volatile ranging from 6 cents to over 65K. Although its regulatory status varies by region and country it continues to evolve as a method of building wealth, along with paying for good and services across the globe. In June 2021, El Salvador became the first country to mandate Bitcoin as legal tender.

As we move toward a global economy where boarders are less relevant the use of crypto currency will allow for individuals, small businesses, and corporations to leverage it to reduce the costs and barriers associated with the purchase of goods and services along with allowing for greater transparency and protections by utilizing the blockchain.

For most digital currency investors, the centralized cryptocurrency exchange is one of the most important vehicles for transacting. Centralized cryptocurrency exchanges are online platforms used to buy and sell cryptocurrencies. They are the most common means that investors use to buy and sell cryptocurrency holdings.

Some investors may find the concept of a "centralized" exchange to be somewhat misleading, as digital currencies themselves are often billed as "decentralized." What does it mean for an exchange of this type to be "centralized," and why are these exchanges so crucial for the success of the cryptocurrency industry as a whole?


Differences Between Centralized and Decentralized Exchanges
Centralized exchanges can be used to conduct trades from fiat to cryptocurrency (or vice versa). They can also be used to conduct trades between two different cryptocurrencies. While this may seem to cover all of the potential transaction types, there is still a market for another type of cryptocurrency exchange as well.

Decentralized exchanges are an alternative; they cut out the middle man, generating what is often thought of as a "trustless" environment. These types of exchanges function as peer-to-peer exchanges. Assets are never held by an escrow service, and transactions are done entirely based on smart contracts and atomic swaps.

The crucial difference between centralized and decentralized exchanges is whether or not a middle man is present. Decentralized exchanges are less widespread and less popular as compared with centralized exchanges. Nonetheless, there are more decentralized exchanges all the time, and it's possible that they will give centralized exchanges a run for their money in the future.


Fiat/Cryptocurrency Pairs
It's more common for a centralized exchange to offer cryptocurrency/cryptocurrency pairing at this point. This would allow customers to trade, for instance, bitcoin for ether tokens. Fewer exchanges offer fiat currency/cryptocurrency pairs, which would allow, say, bitcoin for USD exchanges.

Some of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world are those that offer these fiat/cryptocurrency pairs, however. Part of the reason for this is likely that they serve as a direct access point to the cryptocurrency market.

Since many investors in the space are relatively new to investing in digital currencies, they may be more likely to turn to these types of exchanges. Some of these exchanges include Coinbase, Robinhood, Kraken, and Gemini.

Key Elements of Centralized Exchanges
There are new centralized cryptocurrency exchanges all the time. However, not all of them will be successful, and it's not uncommon for these exchanges to fold. The success or failure of an exchange is dependent upon a large number of factors. However, one of the key components to success is trading volume.

Generally speaking, the higher the levels of trading volume, the lower the volatility and market manipulation that's likely to take place on that exchange. Volatility is a crucial consideration. Because of the time it takes for transactions to be completed, the price of a given token or coin can change between the time the transaction is initiated and the time it is finished. The higher the trade volume and the faster the transaction can be processed, the less likely this fluctuation is to be problem.

Another crucial element of a successful centralized exchange is security. While no exchange is completely immune to malicious activity like hacks, some are safer than others.


Crypto Swaps

What is crypto swapping?
Crypto swapping allows you to instantly trade one cryptocurrency for another, with no crypto-to-fiat exchange required. Saving time and paying less in fees are obvious benefits, but it’s far from the only reason users participate in swapping.

Crypto tokens are effectively the keys to their native blockchain’s kingdom, affording holders various benefits within their ecosystems. Token holders may have the opportunity to vote on community governance proposals that guide the future of a project or stake their share in exchange for passive interest income. Swapping makes it easier for crypto users to explore the further reaches of the blockchain, and be a part of multiple projects they wish to support.

Sometimes swaps are necessary to cover the fees on a transaction that can only be paid in a specific blockchain’s native coin. Other times, traders will perform a token swap in the hopes of capitalizing on a move in the market they sense is coming. Participating in certain protocols, such as decentralized finance (DeFi), can only be done via specific blockchains. This means if you’re a Bitcoin user, you may need to swap for some Ethereum or another ERC-20-compatible token if you want access to the DeFi ecosystem.

Crypto swap vs exchange/trade
It’s true that the words “swap” and “trade” can be taken as synonyms, but in crypto parlance they have quite different meanings. Although the end result is essentially the same (start with one coin, end with another), their respective processes vary greatly.

Trading requires exchanging one cryptocurrency for fiat and then purchasing another coin with the fiat you obtained. If taking place on a crypto exchange, you’ll be hit with whatever commission or other fees they charge on both sides of the transaction.

Swapping, on the other hand, allows users to seamlessly transfer one cryptocurrency for an equal amount in value of another. Transactions happen instantaneously, and without the need to first exchange crypto for fiat. Crypto exchanges offer up various “trading pairs”, asset combinations that can be swapped within their platform. Different swap services offer different trading pairs, and those allowing swaps between two very small or obscure coins may be more difficult to find.
