### What is DevOps?

TekPerfect is partnering with GameHeads to train Bay Area youth for careers in the tech industry. There are many paths to get into tech and many jobs when you think of a “developer”. Our bootcamp focuses on “DevOps” (a mixture of development and operations).

Think of an app or video game. You will see a gaming/social experience. But what you don’t see are the code and the foundation it is built upon. DevOps refers to the infrastructure. No matter what you want to build (app, video game, database), you will need the right infrastructure. This foundation allows the user to see the great product without all the bugs or lags or crashes.

Within infrastructure is primarily made up of these four components:
Security - The firewalls and network devices used to access and protect the systems
Operating Systems - The Windows, MacOS, and Linux systems where the applications and websites are hosted
Databases - The systems where the data is stored. For example your Facebook, Twitter, and IG posts are all stored in a database on some server
Custom Code - The custom code that is created to automate the setup and deployment of the servers, databases, and network settings that make up your environment.

These are some of the projects you will learn while in the program:

- Protecting your machine, data and website from hackers
- Building and accessing multiple computers in one line of code
- Help clients store and organize data
- Think of having all of your accounts in one place instead of ten
- Learn how to de-bug and troubleshoot computer issues
