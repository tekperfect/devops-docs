### What is DevOps?

DevOps is the combination of cultural philosophies, practices, and tools that increases an organization's ability to deliver applications and services at high velocity: evolving and improving products at a faster pace than organizations using traditional software development and infrastructure management processes.

Think of an application or video game and all the infrastructure and services required to support that game. Without said infrastrucure and experienced professionals to run it your websites, games, and social media platforms would not run well or be available 24x7.

Within infrastructure is primarily made up of these four components:
Security - The firewalls and network devices used to access and protect the systems
Operating Systems - The Windows, MacOS, and Linux systems where the applications and websites are hosted
Databases - The systems where the data is stored. For example your Facebook, Twitter, and IG posts are all stored in a database on some server
Custom Code - The custom code that is created to automate the setup and deployment of the servers, databases, and network settings that make up your environment.

These are some of the projects you will learn while in the program:

- Protecting your machine, data and website from hackers
- Building and accessing multiple computers in one line of code
- Help clients store and organize data
- Think of having all of your accounts in one place instead of ten
- Learn how to de-bug and troubleshoot computer issues
