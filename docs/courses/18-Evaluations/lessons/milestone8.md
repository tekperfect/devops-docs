1. Delete all your parallels instances and create them from scratch. At the end of creating each instance I strongly recommend you snapshot each instance so you can revert them back to a clean state whenever we use them.

2. Spin up a clean Kali and UTM Metasploitable image and bridge them so that you can demonstrate an attack using one of the known Metasploit attacks.

3. Now that you have verfied that the system is vunerable to attack.

4. Patch the system by running a sudo apt upgrade and install fail2ban.

5. Configure fail2ban to block all access to a system if it is attacked from a system after 5 login failures.

6. Throughout the course we used Kali to attack vunerable systems now we will see the results of an attack on sysetms that have been patched and have tools to prevent remote exploits and DoS attacks. 

7.
