## Evaluation

### Cyber Security

1. Run Kali linux and spin up your Metspolitable image using UTM and import a new VM from your instructor. This VM has approximately 10 accounts that you will need to crack the passwords on. The goal of this exercise is to compromise at least 5 of the 10 accounts using Medusa or John the ripper.

2. Using the Metasploit framework on your Kali Linux box find and execute at least 2 exploits.that are not the  Samba or IRC exploit I have demonstrated.
